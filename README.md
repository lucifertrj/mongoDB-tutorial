You are working on a Tkinter project and want to save the user details securely, you require a database. MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time.   Why use MongoDB?  MongoDB offers faster query processing but with an increased load and system requirements. It provides good cloud services and good storage facilities for a free account. MongoDB is created using Binary JSON format (BSON) to support various data types. Data stored in BSON can be searched and indexed, tremendously increasing performance. MongoDB is easy to scale, and it uses internal memory for storing and accessing data. Check more about MongoDB.
